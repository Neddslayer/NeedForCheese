# Need For Cheese
A (still in development) game about falling into another dimension looking for cheese from the refridgerator at 3 AM.
# Will it be a paid game?
Maybe. Depends how long and hard my team and I work on it.
# Why open source a (maybe) paid game?
I felt like it. I'll probably close the source eventually, so we'll just have to see what the future holds.
